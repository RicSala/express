REST = REpresentational Stateless Transfer

Requirements:

- User existing standards: http, json, url
- Endpoints are collections of data
- Use GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to communicate the actions we are performing
- Client - server architecture
- Request are stateless (each request is separate and not connected to any state on the client not included in the request - the body is not keeping track of the past) 
  ...and cacheable (saving the result for future use - our request will know if nothing has changed)


What RESTful APIs don't do:

- They don't accept remote procedure calls (they are REpresentational, their urls are collections of data, not functions)
- They don't save information about past request of a given client (stateless)
